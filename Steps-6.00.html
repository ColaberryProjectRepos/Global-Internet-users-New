So, if we focus on improving mobile connectivity by investing in mobile network infrastructure, expanding coverage, and promoting the affordability of smartphones. These measures will facilitate internet access on the go.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><strong style="">Increasing availability:&nbsp;</strong>According to the data, countries in Asia, specifically China, have a significantly higher average number of internet users<font color="#ece9e6">&nbsp;</font><span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">(126.59 million)&nbsp;</span>compared to other countries&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">(34.7 million).&nbsp;</span>Similarly, in South America, Brazil has a much higher average number of internet users&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">(735.79 million)</span>&nbsp;compared to other countries<font color="#ece9e6">&nbsp;</font><span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">(20.35 million).</span>&nbsp;We can increase availability by focusing on these regions, expanding internet access, and bridging the digital divide.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><strong style="">Bridge the rural-urban connectivity gap:</strong>&nbsp;Significant disparity in connectivity between rural and urban areas, with slower growth observed in rural regions. In 1996, for example, there were&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">901,049</span><font color="#ece9e6">&nbsp;</font>internet users in rural areas compared to<font color="#ece9e6">&nbsp;</font><span style="color: rgb(17, 138, 15);">86,801,127</span><font color="#ece9e6">&nbsp;</font>in urban areas. with this being said, I do recommend targeting initiatives to reduce this gap and improve connectivity in rural regions.</li><li style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><strong style="">Improve broadband connectivity:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>we<strong style="">&nbsp;</strong>need to enhance broadband infrastructure in Oceania, particularly in areas where growth has been limited. In 2016, for instance, there was a negative&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(207, 0, 0);">15%</span>&nbsp;year-on-year change in connectivity. I think focusing on investments to improve broadband connectivity in the region. Would help a lot in the long run.</li></ol><p style="margin: 0.3em 0px 0px 2em;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1374/6/1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><br></p>
